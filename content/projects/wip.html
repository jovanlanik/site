<p>
	WIP is a <span class="nobreak">work-in-progress<span> game engine using
	OpenGL and a game called Dungeon implemented in it. Dungeon is more of
	a demo than a playable game.
</p>
<p>
	I'm working on a couple of other projects on a private branch of the
	engine but none are ready to be revealed yet ðŸ˜….
