		gtklock is a GTK-based lockscreen for Wayland and seems to be my most succesful
		project. It's available on many linux distributions.
		</p>
		<p>
		I was dissatisfied with the options available
		at the time and decided to create an alternative by taking the UI of
		<a href="https://git.sr.ht/~kennylevinsen/gtkgreet">gtkgreet</a> and writing a
		<span class="nowrap">wlr-layer-shell/wlr-input-inhibitor</span> lockscreen around
		it. It slowly grew with new features such as module support and was ported to the
		new <span class="nowrap">ext-session-lock</span> protocol.
