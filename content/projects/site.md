This website is generated by my tool sitegen.
It uses Jinja2 for templates and the content is written in HTML or Markdown.
I try to create most graphics for the site on my own but some are
<del>stolen</del> adapted from elsewhere on the web.
### sitegen
A very simple (and limited) python tool for generating static websites.
All the heavy lifting is done by the
[Jinja2](https://jinja.palletsprojects.com/en/3.1.x/") and
[Markdown](https://python-markdown.github.io/) libraries.
It shares the git repo with site content.
